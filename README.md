# Wav2Vec-Child_Dataset-
This repository contains a colab notebook where I have tested how Wav2Vec model works on Child data and have also created another notebook to check the word error rate of the model after retrainoing it .Results are  given in the noteboooks.If you want a detailed explanation of the model and what is the process I have followed while implementing this project please check my medium blog post.
